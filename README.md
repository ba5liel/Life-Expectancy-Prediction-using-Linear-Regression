## Abstract
We have implemented a Linear Regression model to predict the life expectancy of the human population. Our best model achieved an adjusted R-squared value of 0.81, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 3.96, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.99. The model was trained on a processed dataset containing approximately 2938 observations with 22 variables related to life expectancy and health factors for 193 countries. This data was sourced from the Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository under the World Health Organization (WHO).

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict life expectancy using various health and socio-economic factors. By leveraging Linear Regression, we've created a model that can provide insights into the factors influencing life expectancy across different countries.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes information on:
- Life expectancy
- Health factors
- Socio-economic indicators
- Data from 193 countries

## Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Feature Selection
4. Model Development using Linear Regression
5. Model Evaluation

## Results
Our best performing model achieved:
- Adjusted R-squared: 0.81
- RMSE: 3.96
- MAE: 2.99

These results indicate that our model explains approximately 81% of the variance in life expectancy and has an average prediction error of about 3-4 years.

## Future Work
- Explore other machine learning algorithms
- Incorporate more recent data
- Investigate feature interactions
